# EnergyEfficient_CNN_Infer_Accelerator

Developed an energy-efficient FPGA accelerator for a CNN model in Verilog, implementing data quantization and loop unrolling, achieving a ~36% reduction in energy efficiency with a 40% decrease in resource utilization. Implemented on the DE10 Intel FPGA board, the RTL simulation and the testbenches were written in Quartus and QuestaSim. This project was an implementation of this research paper: K. Guo, S. Zeng, J. Yu, Y . Wang, and H. Yang, “A Survey of FPGA-Based Neural Network Accelerator,”.
